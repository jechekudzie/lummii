                        <h2>Who Are The Reitan Group</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Reitan group is one of the largest companies in Scandinavia. Based in Norway, they
                            employ more than 38,000 people across 7 countries and boasted a gross revenue of 95 billion
                            Norwegian krone in 2019 – they own the 7-Eleven operating license.
                        </p>
                        <h4>This Best.Energy partner saved 7-Eleven 2.7 million kWh of energy…</h4>
                        <p>
                            Best.Energy’s flagship partner in Denmark – IQ Energy Nordic – have forged a remarkable
                            relationship with a huge player in the local convenience store market.
                            Working closely with Reitan Group, they have orchestrated a 120-store roll-out of Eniscope –
                            the world’s most complete energy monitoring system.
                            The result? A huge saving of 2,700,000 kWh and over 864 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Watch how
                            the project unfolded in the video (RIGHT) or read on.

                        <h4>The Context</h4>
                        <p>
                            Reitan hold the license to operate 7-Eleven in Denmark and, as such, control all stores
                            across the country.
                            Reitan have been working with Best.Energy partner IQ Energy Nordic. One of Best.Energy’s
                            longest established and most trusted partners, IQ Energy is led by Jesper Kjærulff and Frank
                            Schyberg; supported ably by a professional team of energy managers

                        <h4>The Multi-site rollout</h4>
                        <p>With Best.Energy providing additional product, monitoring and technical support wherever
                            required, IQ Energy forged the relationship and took it through Proof of Concept (PoC) to a
                            full multi-site rollout.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Why did they seek an energy management solution?</h4>
                        <p>Reitan were experiencing three key drivers that pushed them to seek a solution:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>1. Denmark brought in a legal requirement to differentiate between energy types for tax
                                purposes. To fulfil their statutory requirements, they needed an accurate energy
                                monitoring system that could isolate certain energy types consider for ‘comfort’.
                            </li>
                            <li>2. The Reitan Group are a responsible organisation, with increasing requirements for CSR
                                (Corporate Social Responsibility) reporting and reductions in CO2 emissions. They needed
                                an effective way to bring their energy usage and the associated environmental cost down,
                                across the whole network of stores.
                            </li>
                            <li>3. They needed to save money. They were looking for a project that could combine
                                significant savings with a short ROI period.
                            </li>

                        </ol>

                        <h4>The Proof of Concept</h4>
                        <p>Jesper and the team installed Eniscope at four locations considered ‘typical’ of the full
                            portfolio.</p>
                        <h4>Our trademark “no cost or low cost” solutions</h4>
                        <p>
                            All the incredible savings above were achieved with what we call ‘low cost or no cost’
                            solutions – ie. by identifying wastage using the Eniscope’s comprehensive data and acting to
                            address these problems with behaviour modification or technical
                            So impressed were they with the initial project, IQ Energy have now successfully rolled the
                            same solution out to a total of 120 stores across the country.
                        </p>
                        <h4>No Cost</h4>
                        <p>Nothing to pay now, or in the future. Save money by changing habits.</p>
                        <h4>Low Cost</h4>
                        <p>A small, tactical investment will transform you into a green company.</p>
                        <h4>On-going savings</h4>
                        <p>Every day that goes by, your facility is making smart energy saving decisions.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <h4>The Rollout</h4>
                        <p>With Eniscope now operating in 120 stores, IQ Energy receive and report on a huge amount of
                            data. In essence, Reitan have outsourced their energy management functions for this
                            portfolio – allowing IQ Energy to identify new opportunities for energy savings and deliver
                            on them on an ongoing basis.
                            The IQ Energy team report for benchmarking purposes on a quarterly basis, allowing Reitan to
                            compare the performance of each store against each other. In this way, they learn from the
                            best practice demonstrated by one store and can apply it to the others.
                            The same Eniscope system also enables Reitan to fulfil their yearly CSR reporting
                            obligations and has allowed them to meet their tax requirements consistently and accurately.
                        </p>

                        <br/>
                        <h4>The raw results</h4>
                        <p>In terms of raw figures, the full rollout equates (so far) to some incredible savings.
                            “In 2013 we met IQ Energy and were introduced to the Eniscope system. It gave us the
                            opportunity to monitor our energy consumption in a whole different way. I’ve never seen a
                            system like that, even though I’ve had a lot of meetings with a lot of providers. It’s been
                            very easy, the platform is very intuitive. I would recommend the Eniscope system to other
                            companies. I have already recommended it internally in our group to our seven countries.”

                        <h4>looking to the future</h4>
                        <p>Following such a considerable success, Reitan are now looking at similar projects for
                            7-Eleven stores in Sweden and Norway.</p>
